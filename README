== Welcome to Annotation

Annotation := An annotation is a special form of syntactic metadata
that can be added to source code to drive behavior at the point of definition.

== Problem

The problem I wanted to solve is hidden filters. So often I am reading
what some controller is tring to do and failing because I have
forgotten to check on the before_filter declarations normally at the
top of the source file.

    class UsersController
        before_filter :something, :something_else

        # long source file 

        def something
        end

        def something_else
        end
    end

The idea is that we should be declaring these dependencies close to
each other in the file so that these mistakes do not slow us down. The
obvious answer is to just move the call to the before_filter

    class UsersController

        # long source file 

        before_filter :something
        def something
        end

        before_filter :something_else
        def something_else
        end
    end

This this is a simple improvement to the usual approach it does
require that the method name is repeated.

Essentally, what we are looking for here is the ability to associated
behavior with the method. In this case is is wrapping the method with
a call to another method but technically we need this for any
additional  behavior that needs to relate to a method.

This annotation gem allows you to "annotate" the method that follows
making it easier to associate behavior.

       class UsersController

             annotation :before_filter
             def something
             end

             annotation :before_filter
             annotation :after_filter
             def something_else
             end
       end
